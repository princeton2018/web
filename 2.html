English/Math Enrichment Courses
English/Math Enrichment courses have been carefully designed to help students in grades 5–9 get a head start on developing the knowledge necessary for academic success. Students build foundational skills in reading, writing, and math that will help them excel in virtually every class they will encounter in junior high and high school. Middle school students are at a critical developmental point as they transition into High School. Students move from what is concrete and repeatable to what is abstract and theory-laden. Those who flourish are those who can think critically and write powerful essays. This summer program is designed to give students those exact tools. How will we do this? 
First, we will do this by giving them intellectual and writing exemplars to engage with, people like C.S. Lewis, Plato, and Dorothy Sayers. Each week we will discuss a new text while sharpening particular writing skills. In addition to weekly papers, we will craft and develop a thesis paper over the course of the summer. This paper will unite everything we will have worked on thus far.
